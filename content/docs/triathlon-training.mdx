This guide explains how you can adapt the **Next SaaS Stripe Starter** for a triathlon training service.

## Setup

<Steps>

### Customize the Database

Add models for athletes, workouts and training plans in your Prisma schema. After updating the schema, run:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### Create Training Plans

Populate your database with sample workouts and weekly plans. You can provide free plans and premium plans unlocked through Stripe subscriptions.

### Track Workouts

Build pages where athletes can log workouts and view progress over time. The starter already includes authentication and a dashboard layout you can extend.

</Steps>

## Typical User Flows

1. Athletes sign up or log in.
2. They choose a training plan that matches their goals.
3. Daily workouts are tracked in the dashboard.
4. Upgrading a subscription unlocks advanced analytics and coaching features.

This is just one example of how the starter can power a triathlon focused SaaS.
